<p>Welcome! While I am abroad in Uganda interning with <a href="http://boscouganda.com/"> BOSCO Uganda </a>, I am 
creating this webpage as a way to share with firends and family some of my experiences. I am planning on sharing 
photos and using those images as portals into the things I am seeing and experiencing. I hope you enjoy!</p>
<p>I am also using this page in order to learn and practice using html, css, and bootstrap. So if you follow along
throughout the summer. Hopefully this page will continue to look better and better!</p>
