						<h5 class="font-weight-bold font-italic">May 29th - Day 1</h5>
						<p>It is 9 o'clock on Wednesday May 29th. This is the first day of the climb. We are all packed up and ready. Now we are just waiting to be picked up. I am full of excitement, anticipation, and nerves. It is sort of the 6am in the gym kind of nerves where you know what you are about to do, but you also know you are going to grind your way through it. I am ready to GRIND! </p>
						<p>It is 6pm on the first day! We have finished climbing for the day and are now at camp to rest and get ready for the next day. The climb today was not too difficult. We made it all the way through the rainforest portion of the climb. The forest was beautiful. It was full of life! I definitely feel tired today, but it is comparable to swimming for a day. By this I mean that you aren't super sore and your muscles aren't quite broken down like a lift. Yet you definitely feel physically exhausted after 6 or so hours of climbing. It was not too difficult today with the altitude. We have climbed to the 3000m mark. I definitely feel some things that I think could be altitude, but it is a very low level right now, about a discomfort of 1 or 2. We have spent the entire hike talking about almost everything from religion to culture to politics to school to families etc. It is crazy hope much the space opens you up to share since you are isolated together. This reminds me of the lake that Fr. Hesburgh would always go to. He used to take people like his committee on civil rights there so they could come together on decisions. </p>
						<p>It is the first night of the expedition. They are taking excellent care of us! The food has honestly been top class. We had a cucumber soup that was amazing! The fish fillet was very good as well. The "toilet" is about a 20 ft deep hole inside of a shack. They give us water to wash but it is a small little bowl. No showers until we get back - this will be fun.</p> 
						<p>It is pretty warm right now inside my tent which I am very happy about. Looking forward to a great night and day 2.</p>
						<p>Grateful for guide and porters, Haley and Rebecca, warm place to sleep, clean water, headlamp. </p>

						<h5 class="font-weight-bold font-italic">May 30 - Day 2</h5>
						<p>It is the morning of the second day. It was hard to sleep last night. The sleeping bag was very tight, but it was warm. The ground is obviously hard. I am hoping I'll be exhausted tomorrow so I can sleep!</p>

						<p>We climbed for about 5 hours today. We are at 3750m. The climb was definitely harder today - a lot more straight up climbing. We covered less mileage today but gained a lot of altitude. A lot of stretching is going to be necessary in order to make sure that my body is capable of the rest of the journey. We arrived at the next camp around 1pm. Again, the meals here are very good. I have been more than impressed. We are now just relaxing before a short walk to help acclimatize. I am definitely exhausted right now. I am choosing not to take a nap out of fear I won't be able to sleep later - we'll have to see if that is smart or stupid. I drank about 2.5 liters of water this climb which is good. I definitely don't think skipping water is a wise idea.</p>
						<p>The mountain had a beautiful way of teaching you to embrace the unknown. You never know if around a corner will be a camp, another corner, or even a steep climb. As a result, it forces you to go through with no expectation and just enjoy whatever challenge or wonder God has waiting for you around the corner. </p>

						<h5 class="font-weight-bold font-italic">May 31st - Day 3</h5>
						<p>I bad talked the mountain and the mountain punched me in the face. Last night was tough. Temperatures dipped below freezing at night which made it difficult to sleep. From now on I am going to sleep any chance I get during the day because it is warmer. I had said that climbing the mountain wasn't as hard as running a marathon, but the mountain isn't like a marathon. The mountain tests your physical endurance and fortitude to push your body, but it goes beyond a marathon by testing your patience. The mountain is long! Instead of one battle, the mountain is a chain of major battles - one after the other (continually getting harder). It tests your ability to endure heat, cold, little sleep, physical toil, and mental fortitude. No longer will I underestimate the great Mount Kili for truly it is a gauntlet. </p>

						<p>Hardest day so far! Today was an absolute grind. Going up wasn't too hard - got up to 4700m at Lava Tower. We then came down to 3900m for camp. The environment went from desert to a lush green river flowing valley. Truly a beautiful day, but the way down from Lava Tower was tough. It was very slippery, and we were going down very quick. </p>
						<p>The climb again was not the hard part of the day since time at the camp was full of altitude poison/illness. I had a pretty bad headache today as we got to camp. It settled down though and I feel fine now after taking some Advil. Luckily, I still have my appetite! Honestly, I have been doing a great job hydrating. I finished both 3 liters on each walk. I am going to continue to pound the water because I think it is helping with the altitude. One of my companions has not been so fortunate with the altitude. Despite taking the altitude medicine, she got hit hard today with headaches and an upset stomach.</p>
						<p>Again, Kili does not fail to disappoint! The camp has the most gorgeous stars I have ever seen! WOW! You can see the stars, Milky Way, and the whole universe in a frame.</p>
						<p>Lesson of the day: Small rocks, small fall. Big rocks, big fall. But if you only use small rocks for fear of the big rocks, you'll never get down the mountain.</p>

						<h5 class="font-weight-bold font-italic">June 1st - Day 4</h5>
						<p>We woke up at 5 o'clock today and began with the rock wall. It was a blast & had some fun little climbing maneuvers. From there we moved on into the alpine desert and by the end of the day we were at the base camp. This was the longest and hardest climb so far, but most of the physical toil is due to the culmination of all the days. Overall a very good day - left me nice and exhausted.</p>

						<p>Throughout the trip, I found the song "The Ants Go Marching In" to be a constant joy and companion. LOL, it really became a staple on the tougher climbs. It goes like this:</p>
						<blockquote style="padding-left:100px" class="font-italic">The ants go marching one by one hoorah, hoorah. <br>
						The ants go marching one by one hoorah, hoorah. <br>
						The ants go marching one by one, one of them stops to see his son, <br>
						And they all go marching down, to the ground, to get out, of the rain. <br>
						... </blockquote>
						<p>This would go on for quite a while. It was fun to keep making up different rhymes that fit, and it was a blessing to have a cadence to march with when it got hard.</p>

						<h5 class="font-weight-bold font-italic">June 2nd - Day 5</h5>
						<p>We woke up at 11pm the night before to start the summit at midnight. Without a doubt, the summit was the hardest climb. It consisted of 7 grueling hours of uphill battle that had about a 30° incline and frequent obstacles. All of this was in the pitch black of night where we could only see a step or two ahead. On top of that, the temperature was around freezing and dropping as we ascended. While the climb was certainly physically demanding, the altitude was the hardest part. About 3 hours into the climb I began to feel an intense throbbing in my head. Not too much later I felt nauseous and wasn't sure if I would make it. There was added difficulty because we had no idea how close we were to the end at any given point. Eventually we say a light at the top which provided hope to keep going. In order to get past the pain and nausea, I thought of Jocko Willink's "good" talk where I said good to the pain and suffering because they gave me an opportunity to grow and challenge myself. This along with the ants go marching got me up the mountain. This was definitely one of the hardest physical and mental journeys that I have endured! It truly pushed me to put mind over matter because the hardest parts were the cold isolated down time, with the exception of the last climb. Once I got to Stella Point I immediately sat down thinking we had made it to the top. Little did I know that we still had to walk to Uhuru Point - the highest point in Africa, the Roof of Africa. On the way in between I proceeded to double over and throw up from altitude sickness. Nonetheless, I made it all the way to Uhuru Point and conquered Mt. Kilimanjaro!</p>

						<h5 class="font-weight-bold font-italic">June 3rd - Day 6</h5>
						<p>Nothing too exciting happened after the climb. We were all exhausted and elated. I would like to finish off this account of the journey by recalling one more proverbial lesson I found true during the climb - especially when I tried over rocks:</p>
